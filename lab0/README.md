Question:
---------
Design a mini compiler

Write a program in C which takes another C program as input and checks whether the input
?le contains a C statement of the form X = Y + Z; where X, Y and Z are variables. For each
statement of the above form, check whether the variables are declared. You could assume
each C statement to be present in a separate line and each variable to be declared in a separate
line. Further, the only supported data type is “int”
